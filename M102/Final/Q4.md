Keep the three member replica set from the above problems running. We've had a request to make the third member never eligible to be primary. (The member should still be visible as a secondary.)

Reconfigure the replica set so that the third member can never be primary. Then run:
```
$ mongo --shell a.js --port 27003
```
And run:
```
> part4()
```
And enter the result in the text box below (with no spaces or line feeds just the exact value returned).

```
Ans:
To make the third member(27003) to be always secondary,make it's priority value 0 .Reconfig the replica set.
cfg = rs.conf()
cfg.members[2].priority = 0
rs.status()//Check whether it's priority is assigned to 0
rs.reconfig(cfg)
mongo --shell a.js --port 27003
part4()//233
```
